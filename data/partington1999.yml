cms: "Partington, J. R., <i>A History of Greek Fire and Gunpowder</i>, Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1999."
summary: "Originally published in 1960, this work has copious information, though many of the references are to the author's own publications, making the quality of them hard to evaluate."
date: "1999"
data:

    desc: "French Royal Factory at Essone, near Paris."
    desc2: "This looks very similar to the eprouvette described by Surirey de Saint Remy, excepting that his used a brass not a copper ball.  Partington's reference lists a source from 1735, but dates the tests to 1756, so the data is suspicious at best."
