This is a set of collected works of the inventor of the ballistic pendulum.  As the inventor, some of Robins' notations and work is more cumbersome than later authors.  He will cite the rate of a pendulum in oscillations per time, where an oscillation is either back or forth.  Hutton refers to this as a "small oscillation" to distinguish it from a full oscillation which is both back-and-forth.

The first 153 pages of this volume are the contents of _New Principles of Gunnery_, Robins, 1742 (though retypeset and with some footnotes by the editor).  The data from that section has not been repeated.

Robins tries to produce a formula for the resistance of the air.  His force of drag is proportionate to the square of the velocity up to around 1200 ft/s, after which he arbitrarily multiples that squared amount by a further factor of three.
