This is a continuation of Vol. II, and contains experiments from 1784 through 1791 (at least).

I have used the velocities as computed by Hutton, trusting that he has calculated the force on the pendulum appropriately.  Hutton show on p. 25 that he would get the same results regardless of whether the gun is allowed to swing freely in recoil or not.
