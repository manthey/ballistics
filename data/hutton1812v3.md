This is a continuation of Vol. II, and contains experiments from 1784 through 1791 (at least).

I have used the velocities as computed by Hutton, trusting that he has calculated the force on the pendulum appropriately.  Hutton show on p. 25 that he would get the same results regardless of whether the gun is allowed to swing freely in recoil or not.

Hutton discusses calculating the range of projectiles and concludes that it is very difficult because of air resistance varying based on the density, size, and speed of the projectile, and on the pressure, temperature, and altitude of the environment.

Hutton calculates the maximum velocity a gun of different lengths can throw a projectile (see p. 313).  He notes that using spherical projectiles is a limiting factor.
