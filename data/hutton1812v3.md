This is a continuation of Vol. II, and contains experiments from 1784 through 1791 (at least).

I have used the velocities as computed by Hutton, trusting that he has calculated the force on the pendulum appropriately.  In general, Hutton gets lower values that would be realized in a fixed gun, as the gun hanging from a pendulum will absorb more of the force in recoil than that of a gun fixed on a carriage.
