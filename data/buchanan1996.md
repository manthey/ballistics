This book contains 24 articles by different authors on gunpowder.  Of these, only one contains numerical information that can be used for calculating power factors.  This is a report from 1815 comparing shipping gunpowder in wooden versus copper barrels, where the gunpowder is loading in March, 1814, shipped to India and back, and off-loaded in June, 1815.  The proof was measured on September 5, 1815.

The powder stored in wooden barrels degrades much more than that stored in copper.
