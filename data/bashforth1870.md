Bashforth's chronograph records time from a half-second pendulum on a moving piece of paper.  A series of frames with hanging wires are set up.  When the projectile passes these wires, a mark is made on the same paper as the time record, allowing for accurate time deltas to be determined.

Although many of the experiments are done on ogival shot, many are also done on spherical shot.
