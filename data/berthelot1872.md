This calculates the chemical reactions of gunpowder.  Near the end there is a table of the heat output from a calorimeter.  In some ways this is the maximum amount of power that could be liberated from the gunpowder, as none of the energy escapes.  However, the available oxygen in the calorimeter is not reflective of actual available oxygen from air in a mortar or gun, and, since the gunpowder isn't expanding in the same manner, other differences exist.
