    summary: "This is a modern translation of \"La nova scientia de Nicol\u00f2 Tartaglia con una gionta al terzo libro.\" from 1558.  The first edition was published in 1537.  It doesn't have enough data to supply any values for the analysis with certainty, but there is an example on p. 71.  This says that a 20 libra culverin was fired at angles of 6 quadrant points and 4 quadrant points producing ranges of 1972 and 1872 Veronese pertica respectively.  Unfortunately, no powder charge is give.  However, using Veronese units and assuming a charge equal to the weight of the ball, then these produce power factors on the order of 158 kJ/kg and 115 kJ/kg respectively."
