Although this book was published in 1812, the experiments described in Tract 34 were performed mostly in 1783.

I have used the velocities as computed by Hutton, trusting that he has calculated the force on the pendulum appropriately.  Hutton shows on p. 25 in Vol. III that he would get the same results regardless of whether the gun is allowed to swing freely in recoil or not.

The tract has the virtue that it explains failures, rather than just reporting successful tests.

Of further interest, Hutton shows the formula for the velocity of a bullet based on factors of a ballistic pendulum.  The end equation is on page 324.

- $b$ - mass of the ball
- $p$ - mass of the pendulum
- $g$ - distance from the pendulum's pivot to the center of gravity
- $o$ - distance to the center of oscillation (in modern terms, the center of percussion).  This can be computed from the period, $T$ as $o = \dfrac{T^2 G}{4 \pi^2}$ where $G$ is the acceleration of gravity.
- $i$ - distance to the point of impact
- $c$ - length of the chord of the pendulum's movement
- $r$ - distance to the measurement chord (the radius)
- $v$ - the velocity of the ball

$v = \dfrac{\sqrt G c}{b i r}\sqrt{(p g o + b i i)(p g + b i)}$
