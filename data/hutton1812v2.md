Although this book was published in 1812, the experiments described in Tract 34 were performed mostly in 1783.

I have used the velocities as computed by Hutton, trusting that he has calculated the force on the pendulum appropriately.  Hutton show on p. 25 in Vol. III that he would get the same results regardless of whether the gun is allowed to swing freely in recoil or not.

The tract has the virtue that it explains failures, rather than just reporting successful tests.
