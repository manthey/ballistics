This is a textbook prepared by the master of the Royal Mathematical School in Christ's Hospital, updated through several editions for use by the Naval Academy in Portsmouth.

A set of example problems are given on calculating range, angle of elevation, and powder charge using a 24 lb cannon.  The primary example uses unrealistic numbers, which almost would make sense if Mach effects didn't exist.  All of the other examples are based on this first unrealistic one, so are similarly unbelievable.
