This is a translation of three treatises from the Italian works of Alessandro Vittorio Papacino d'Antoni, the director of the Artillery School in Turin.  The translator notes (p. xxxiii) that "All the weights and measures are reduced to the English standard: this, though a work of much labour, was deemed necessary; and indeed without it, a translation would be very defective.  The same denomination is left to the guns to distinguish their several natures, as in the original; it being found that they corresponded to natures unused among us and to fractional parts: it was therefore apprehended that the most simple mode was to leave the mas they were; the reader only having to recollect that the 32 pr. corresponds to the 27 pr. English; the 16 pr. to 13 1/2; the 8 pr. to 6 3/4; and the 4 pr. to 3 3/8."

The translator goes on to note that the Piedmontese artillerists use the Lypraund foot, and gives a conversion of 1 Lypraund foot is equal to 20.23457 English inches (p. xxxiv), and 1 Piedmontese pound is 13 oz 2 dr English, or 0.82 English pounds (p. xxxv).
