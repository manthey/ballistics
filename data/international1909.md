This is a history of the British explosives industry.  There is a chapter with the history of gunpowder by E. A. Brayley Hodgetts, and a chapter about gunpowder research by G. W. MacDonald.  The chapter on research has a small summary of early test results.

Although the text cites results by Robins and Hutton, the one by Robins must contain some sort of error, as the power factor computed for the gun powder is very low.  The results from Hutton are incomplete and insufficient for calculation.
