This is an excellent account of how the theory of ballistics was developed from the crude beginnings of Aristotle through various authors including Newton, Leibniz, and Huygens, and up to the precise formula of Bernoulli.  The authors observes how "Philosophers from Galileo to Newton ... used the problems of ballistics as a gymnasium in which to develop their powers for larger and more important researches," and how these theories were not developed with utility or even a description of the real world as a goal.  Based on this, the plethora of ballistics treatises without factual data is not a surprise.
