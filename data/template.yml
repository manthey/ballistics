# Each data source should have the following:

# such as Anderson1848, often the base name of the file, too.
key: nameDate
ref: Short reference, like would appear in a foot note
cms: Chicago Manual of Style Bibliographic Reference
link: URL to digital copy, if available
summary: A short description of the data
details: Usually not directly present, if a companion (base file name).md file is adjacent to this file
date: Of publication

skip: True
# Data is a list of dictionaries, each of which can also have a data entry

    # A group is a way of clustering experiments that are all from the same
    # test.  For instance, if the trajectory of a test is measured at multiple
    # points, or if both the range and the time-of-flight is given, then those
    # are groups.  If the data is accurate, then all calculations done on the
    # group should yield the same pwoer factor.  If not, then the ballistics
    # model is at variance with the real-world conditions.
