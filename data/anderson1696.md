This short book is mostly concerned with making rockets and calculating distances and trajectories.  It includes information on how to pack them and to make pyrotechnic stars.

There is a short section on firing mortars, where the units are not specified very well.  My assumption is that some of the charges are in ounces avoirdupois, and that some of the others are in drams avoirdupois.  This seems appropriate from context, and the calculated power factors seem in line with other tests.  The distances are marked "Chain", but I presume them to be in links, not whole chains.
