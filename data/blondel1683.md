This work compares a variety of theories of ballistics with the main focus being on throwing shells.  The author points out the absurdity of others' theories and promulgates his own, which is a variation of using a parabolic path.  He shows how this applies when the target is at a different elevation.

As part of showing other theories, he presents a theoretical table of ranges with varying angles of projection, plus a variety of results from different sources.

The author considers air resistance (see p. 336), but doesn't use it in the calculations.
