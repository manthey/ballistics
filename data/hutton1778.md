Charles Hutton makes some experiments with two ballistic pendulums after the matter proposed by Benjamin Robins.  He attempts to determine the various sources of error and indicates that the results are probably accurate to 1 part in a few hundred.  The text describes the geometry of the pendulums fairly well.

I have taken Hutton's computed velocities.  One could recompute them all, but I have not.
