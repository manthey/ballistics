The author compares different powder and comments on what he thinks is the best to use for shooting birds.  His tests use a very short barreled mortar, which shows fine powder to advantage, as the large powder doesn't have a chance to combust before the ball has moved.

On p. 28, the author mentions glazing powder with black-lead.  This is the earliest reference to graphite glazing that I have found.
