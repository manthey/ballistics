This is a republication of Robins' book with footnotes by Charles Hutton.

Hutton describes, p. 135-136, that Robins' formula for the resistance of air is quite right.  Specifically, the factor of three increase in resistance when velocities exceed 1200 ft/s is too much.  Hutton states that the increase should be more like a factor of 2.1.  He further states that the relationship is not conformable to such a simple rule, and that a table of actual resistance values should be used instead.
