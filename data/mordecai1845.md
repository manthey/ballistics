The author was asked to erect at Washington Arsenal a ballistic pendulum, and a gun pendulum, to serve for experiments in gunnery and also for the proof of gunpowder.

The beginning of the volume has an excellent description of the pendulums used, how the guns are loaded, and how the system is maintained.

Overall the experiments are wide-ranging, carefully performed, and quite illuminating.  Only testing powder in the intended weapons fully reveals what is most appropriate.  Using blanks in an eprouvette does not show the relative merits of power in long-arms, mortars, or cannons.
