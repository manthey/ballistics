The author was asked to erect at Washington Arsenal a ballistic pendulum, and a gun pendulum, to serve for experiments in gunnery and also for the proof of gunpowder.

The beginning of the volume has an excellent description of the pendulums used, how the guns are loaded, and how the system is maintained.
