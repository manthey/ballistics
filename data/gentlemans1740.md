This is a short article that compares English with captured Spanish gunpowder.  The full text is below:

I assume that when *drams* are specified, that these are drams avoirdupois, and not Troy drams (the results are weak enough that the smaller unit seems more likely).

This powder gets terrible results, to the point that I suspect some gross error in the reported values.  The power between the lifting test and the swivel gun test is comparable, though.

Complaint having been made to the Lords of the Admiralty that the Gunpowder used by the 3 Men of War when they took the *Princessa* was weaker than the Powder taken in the said Ship in Proportion of 7 to 12, it was thought proper to make a publick Tryal; in order thereto some Gunpowder was taken out of each of the above 4 Ships, put into 4 Boxes at Portsmouth which were seal'd up by some Officers of the Navy and Ordnance, and sent to Town, and this Day try'd at *Woolwich* before the D. of *Montagu* Master General of the Ordnance, Sir *Charles Wager*, Lord Vere *Beauclerk*, General *Borgard*, some Captains of Men of War, &c. in three divers Ways.  1. By raising a Weight of 20 l. 7 Ounces with two Drams of Powder.  2. By firing a twelve Pounder shot Shot out of a 5 2/3 Inch Mortar with a Quarter of an ounce of Powder.  3. By Firing a half-pounder Shot out of a Swivel Gun with two Drams of Powder.  In the first Experiment the *English* Powder raised the Weight from four Inches to six and some tenths, and the *Spanish* no higher than one Inch and 9 tenths: In proving by the Swivel Gun the *English* Powder threw the Ball 15 1/7 Foot at an Elevation of 61 Degrees, and the *Spanish* had not Strength enough to throw it out of the Gun; and the Tryal by the Mortar turn'd out equally in favour of the *English* Powder. --- *Notwithstanding the above Account, many Persons who have been at* Portsmouth *affirm that the Shot of the* Pricessa *were much Sharper thrown than those of our Men of War, some of hers going through the Sides of our Ships, when ours stuck in her Half-way.*
