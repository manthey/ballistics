In the introduction, Muller gives some historical data.  He oddly criticizes Robins, including calling into question some of the measurements made with the ballistic pendulum.  Muller gives a table on p. xxxviii claiming that certain size balls cannot exceed certain initial velocities or ranges, without using experiments to back this up.  As this is not supported by any other researcher's data, it makes all of Muller's theory questionable.  As Muller published well-regarded books on fortifications, this is surprising.
