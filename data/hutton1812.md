Although this book was published in 1812, the experiments described in Tract 34 were performed mostly in 1783.

I have used the velocities as computed by Hutton, trusting that he has calculated the force on the pendulum appropriately.  In general, Hutton gets lower values that would be realized in a fixed gun, as the gun hanging from a pendulum will absorb more of the force in recoil than that of a gun fixed on a carriage.

The tract has the virtue that it explains failures, rather than just reporting successful tests.
