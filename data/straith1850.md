This book includes a section on gunpowder manufacturing in India.  It has a section on proof requirements using mortars, a pendulum eprouvettes, a rifle eprovette fired through a number of wooden boards, and several other methods.  Only the first tests have enough information to calculate power factors.

The section on using pendulum eprovettes suggests that such an eprovette doesn't always give accurate results.  In this, a charge is loaded into a pendulum-hanging gun, and the arc of recoil  is measured.  Here the powder is acting more like a rocket, and is not used to fire a projectile.  Without knowing the length of the pendulum arm, the data is insufficient to calculate power generated by the gunpowder.
