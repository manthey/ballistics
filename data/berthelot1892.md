This includes a variety of sources of measuring the heat output of gunpowder using sealed calorimeters.  In some ways this is the maximum amount of power that could be liberated from the gunpowder, as none of the energy escapes.  However, the available oxygen in the calorimeter is not reflective of actual available oxygen from air in a mortar or gun, and, since the gunpowder isn't expanding in the same manner, other differences exist.

The authors find that the theoretical heat produced by gunpowder with pure carbon (rather than charcoal) would be lower than the realized values.
