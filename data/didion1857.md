Didion produces equations for air resistance based on ball velocity, atmospheric density, and ball size.  He compares the results of his equations with the experimental data from Robin, Hutton, and Metz.  His final resistance equation is:

$\rho = 0.027 \pi R^2 v^2 (1 + 0.0023 v)$  (p. 79)

for an atmospheric density of 1.2083 kg/m/m/m.
