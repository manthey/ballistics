# Analysis

## [Computation](#/computation)

To examine the collected data, the amount of power generated per unit weight of gunpowder is computed using exterior ballistics.

## Drag Model

The exterior ballistics depends heavily on the accurate calculation of atmospheric drag.  Some of the source data was recorded specifically to help determine drag effects.

## Interpretation

The data varies in quality and includes results on both good and bad gunpowder.  Some statistical analysis can be performed to try to identify trends.
